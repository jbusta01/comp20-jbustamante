Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.


All aspects from the assignment were correctly implemented. All the captions appear 
as they are said in the video. There is styling and I only used java Script to 
fullfill the assignment.


Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.


I worked alone and consulted the websites that were listed in the assignment page. 
I also used Piazza to ask some questions and read over some answers that TA's
had Posted. 



Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.


At first I had trouble understanding the way we were supposed to implement the file
but once I understood what was supposed to happen the lab was pretty stright forward. 
I worked in the lab for two days. About 1 hour per day.
