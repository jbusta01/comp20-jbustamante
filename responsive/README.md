Each assignment and lab shall include a README file that describes the work. This description must:

Identify what aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not.


The lab works as expected. At the begining it was only working for mobile 
web browsers, but then I identifies a an attribute bug. I had used the 
attribute min-device-width insead of min-width. The first attribute (bug) 
renders the entire screen or page, rather than just the rendering area, while min-width
analyzes the size of the window diplaying the content. 
I also had trouble linking via the ssh protocol, it displayed errors regarding 
auhtentication issues. I could not push most of my initial work because of that. 
I solved the issue by ussing the http protocol instead. 


Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.


I worked alone in the assignemnt, but visited many sites such as the ones listed below: 
https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp
https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp
https://www.sitepoint.com/media-queries-width-vs-device-width/
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/
https://varvy.com/pagespeed/combine-images-css-sprites.html




Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.


The assignemnt took me two days to complete with about 1.5 hours each day. This totals to 3 hours. 
Mostly trying to solve ssh bug that was described above, and the attribute variable name 
misuse.
