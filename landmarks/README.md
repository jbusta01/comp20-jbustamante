All aspects of the project were correctly implemented. The map loads, sends the location places 
the tags with corresponding information. Upon clickling ones position the infowindow changes and
displays information related to the closest landmark as well as rendering a polyline.


Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment.



I used piazza and the linked resources of the homework as well as google developer 
sites for information regading the fuctions and the working of it. 



Say approximately how many hours you have spent completing the assignment.


I spent about 3 hours a day coding the project and dedicated 3 days to it. Also, I spent a lot of 
time finding silly (and embarassing) bugs such as typos.
